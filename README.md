# Various-CoD-Tools
Various tools for memory editing and recovery as well as trainers and shaders.


The main focus of this repo is to make an easily accessible list of working tools as well as updates to maintain them. This includes recovery/rtm tools, console tools, and shader mods. Most tools aren't mine and are credited as best I could when finding them. Use at your own risk as tools listed have been tested safely but still may result in accounts bans and whatnot. Any contributions and communication on which tools need work are greatly appreciated.

Fix for CoD WW2 worked out for update released on 02/12/26. Read "WW2 Reversion.txt" for more detailed info.
